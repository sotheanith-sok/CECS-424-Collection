1.  Translate the following expression into postfix and prefix notation
    (b ∗ b − 4 ∗ a + c)/(2 ∗ a)
    Answer: 
            Prefix notation: 
                / + - * b b * 4 a c * 2 a
            Postfix notation: 
                b b * 4 a * - c + 2 a * /
2.  Consider the following program in C++. What will be the final values
    of fp count and int count? Why?
    
    int fp_count = 0, int_count = 0;
    for (float i = 0; i < 1; i += 0.01) {
        fp_count++;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
        int_count++;
    }
    Anwer:
        The final outputs of fp_count is 101 and int_count is 100. 
        The reason why the final fp_count is 101 instead of 100 is
        due to the rounding error that occur when a computer try to convert
        fraction as binary value. It is impossible for a computer to store accurate 
        value of some numbers such as fraction.
